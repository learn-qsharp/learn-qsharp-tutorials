# Complex Arithmetic
This is a tutorial designed to introduce you to complex arithmetic. This topic isn't particularly expansive, but it's important to understand it to be able to work with quantum computing.

This tutorial covers the following topics:

* Imaginary and complex numbers
* Basic complex arithmetic
* Complex plane
* Modulus operator
* Imaginary exponents
* Polar representation

If you need to look up some formulas quickly, you can find them in [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas/blob/master/quickref/qsharp-quick-reference.pdf).

If you are curious to learn more, you can find more information at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).
