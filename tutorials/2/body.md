# Introduction to Linear Algebra
This is a tutorial designed to introduce you to the basics of linear algebra. Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics dedicated to studying the properties of matrices and vectors, which are used extensively in quantum computing to represent quantum states and operations on them. This tutorial doesn't come close to covering the full breadth of the topic, but it should be enough to get you comfortable with the main concepts of linear algebra used in quantum computing.

This tutorial assumes familiarity with complex numbers; if you need a review of this topic, we recommend that you complete the Complex Arithmetic tutorial before tackling this one.

This tutorial covers the following topics:

* Matrices and vectors
* Basic matrix operations
* Operations and properties of complex matrices
* Inner and outer vector products
* Tensor product
* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

If you need to look up some formulas quickly, you can find them in [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas/blob/master/quickref/qsharp-quick-reference.pdf).
